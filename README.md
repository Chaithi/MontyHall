After watching a YouTube video on the Monty Hall problem (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggDQXlinbME), I wanted to wrap my head around the logic of it and see the evidence.

For those unfamiliar, Monty Hall was the host of a game show in the 70s called Let's Make a Deal. In that, a contestant was offered a great prize behind one of three doors. The other two doors had gag prizes behind them. After choosing a door, one of the remaining doors that contained a gag prize was revealed.

Monty would then give the contestant a choice: stay with your choice or switch.

In my mind, the choice would come down to a 50/50 at that point. I have one of two possible doors and no matter which I chose would be an equal shot.

Right?

Wrong.

As you can see by running this script, the odds are 2:1 in your favor if you switch. 66% to 33%. The video linked above does a good job of explaining why this is.

Math is fun!
